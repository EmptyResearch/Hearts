# Hearts
C++ Card Game

Welcome to my Hearts game! Currently still in development, this simple Hearts C++ program was created by EmptyResearch (me).

If you didn't know, Hearts is a classic card game played with 2 - 4 players. (You can read more on <a href=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts>Wikipedia</a>.)
