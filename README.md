# Hearts
Python Card Game

Welcome to my Hearts game! Currently still in development, this simple Hearts Python program was created by EmptyResearch (me).

If you didn't know, Hearts is a classic card game played with 2 - 4 players. (You can read more on <a href=http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts>Wikipedia</a>.) Every player tries to not win any tricks with hearts, because they will gain points. The player with the least points wins.
